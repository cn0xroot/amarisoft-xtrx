instructions when prompted by the Product.
The type of license you may acquire is a Standard License or a Floating License, all defined in Sections 1.1 and

development. As part of any contract, whether it includes the payment of NRE or not, you must accept
without reservation that AMARISOFT is the rightful owner of all intellectual property rights for the Product
